The key to getting a lot of value from reading books is to quit those that don't offer you any value, quickly. Chances are most of the books that you pick up won't have actionable information for you to digest, and so as much as speed reading and memory retention are important skills when it comes to reading, so to is your ability to quit a book.

To that end — here is a list of books that I have started, partially read and decided I will not finish.

### [Deep Learning in Production — Sergios Karagiannakos](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6180033773/)

A nicely put together book that gives a good overview of the components of ML deployment in production. This information could have been extracted from a few Medium posts or a Youtube Video. But the cover looked nice, so I bought the shiny object.
